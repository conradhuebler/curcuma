# CLAUDE.md - Curcuma Source Directory

## Overview

This directory contains the complete Curcuma source code organized into four main subsystems:
- **capabilities/** - High-level molecular modeling tasks and applications
- **core/** - Core computational engines and data structures
- **tools/** - Utilities and file I/O operations
- **helpers/** - Development tools and standalone utilities

## Structure

```
src/
├── capabilities/          # Application-level functionality
├── core/                 # Core computational engines  
├── tools/                # Utilities and I/O
├── helpers/              # Development tools

└── global_config.h.in    # Global configuration template
```

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- All new functions marked as "Claude Generated" for traceability
- Doxygen-ready documentation for new and frequently used functions
- Remove completed TODO hashtags when approved
- Use std::cout for debugging within `#ifdef DEBUG_ON #endif`
- Port std::cout to fmt for non-debugging console output
- Replace deprecated suprafit functions when compiler warnings appear

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Check CMakeLists.txt and includes for DEBUG_ON configuration

### Architecture Principles
- Each subsystem maintains its own CLAUDE.md with specific information
- Variable sections contain short-term information and current bugs
- Preserved sections contain permanent knowledge and patterns
- Instructions blocks contain future tasks and development visions

## Instructions Block

**PRESERVED - DO NOT EDIT BY CLAUDE**

*This section is reserved for operator/programmer instructions and approved future development tasks*

## Variable Section

### Current Development Focus
- Native GFN-FF implementation (`cgfnff`) debugging in core/qm_methods/
- Universal parameter caching system completed and working
- Enhanced force field multi-threading support

### Recent Improvements
- Parameter caching system with 96% speedup demonstrated
- Multi-threading safety controls for concurrent calculations
- Automatic parameter validation and method compatibility checks
